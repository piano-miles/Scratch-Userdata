# Scratch-API

This is a Python program to collect data about Scratch projects and users. It is for my Statistics project.

- Currently, the main code is in `local/main.ipynb`. The code is not yet complete.
- A web version is also currently undergoing development.
- `local/base.py` and `local/minibase.py` are the old programs from version `1.0.1`.

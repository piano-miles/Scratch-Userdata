# Scratch-Userdata

This is a Python program to collect data about Scratch projects and users for my Statistics project.

The code for data collection is in `./local/main.py`. The code uses a lot of RAM, so make sure you have at least 4GB.

Results and analysis are in `./results`.

The web version currently does not work, because pyodide has issues saving external files to the virtual file system.
